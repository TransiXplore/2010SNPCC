# 2010SNPCC
TransiXplore  analysis of Kessler et al, 2010 SN Photometric Classification Challenge data set


The data from [Kessler *et al.*, 2010](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1008.1024) are given in the `data` folder.  

The notebook [pre_PLAsTiCC_starting_kit.ipynb](https://github.com/TransiXplore/2010SNPCC/blob/master/pre_PLAsTiCC_starting_kit.ipynb) allows you to read the data and header information. 

The difference between this notebook and the [complete RAMP source](https://github.com/ramp-kits/supernovae)  is that here we have 3 classes: Ia, Ibc and II.
